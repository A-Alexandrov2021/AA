👋 Hello! I'm Alexander, but you can call me Alex.

🔒 I'm an enthusiastic engineer with a strong passion for Information Security, Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL). I firmly believe in the power of open-source software to drive innovation and progress in the tech world.

💻 My general interests revolve around programming, security, development operations (DevOps), and cloud computing. I love diving deep into code, building secure systems, and optimizing processes.

🎓 On the academic side, I'm particularly intrigued by topics such as honeypots, honeyclients, botnet tracking, malware analysis, and intrusion detection and prevention. These areas challenge me to stay at the forefront of cybersecurity research and threat mitigation.

🌐 Additionally, I've the opportunity to experiment with integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and various Cyber Security Tools into my projects. It's an exciting journey as we leverage the power of AI to enhance security and protect against evolving threats.

🌟 I'm always eager to collaborate and learn from the vibrant tech community on GitHub. Feel free to explore my repositories and drop me a message if you share similar interests or want to work on exciting projects together.
